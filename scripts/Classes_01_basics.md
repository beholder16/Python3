# Classes

## Defining Classes

### Objects & Classes

* Objects  
Data(Variables, Attributes) or Codes(Functions, Methods)  
Objects are **_THE UNIQUE INSTANCE_** of something concrete.  

* Classes  
Number ```7```, String ```'keyboard'``` and Function ```adder``` are _Objects_, **Each of them represents something concrete**.  Number ```7``` represents An Attribute 'Number' _Seven_, Using **_Class_** ```int```.  
String ```keyboard``` represents An Attribute 'Word' _keyboard_, Using **_Class_** ```str```.  
and Function ```adder``` represents A Function 'Code' _adder', Using  **_Class_** ```function```.  

* Methods  
Classes have Methods. For example, ```str``` **_Class_** has ```.find()``` or ```.upper()``` Methods.  
**These Methods are defined in** ```str``` **_Class_** **and called for some operation with its Attribute(Data) ** _keyboard_.  


> In **O**bject-**O**riented **P**rogramming(**OOP**),  Attributes & Methods are hierarchically classificated into Classes.  
> **_Classes_** are sort of boxes, which is classificated by its usage.  
> (A steel box for heavy things, a paper box for books, and a plastic box for fishes or water thing.)  
> Like this, **Each** **_Classes_** **are defined & ready to deal with Data & Codes.**  
> With **_Instance_**, **_Classes_** are _instantiated_ and **_Objects_** that have some concrete things are generated.
